Code for the Master's Project at Hertfordshire University: Analysis of Volcanic
Data through modern Data Science methodology

The main goal of this project will be to construct an analysis pipeline that tries to improve upon the one that was used in the 1990â€™s to analyze the RADAR data coming from the Magellanic mission in Venus. The data set consists of thousands of images with a corresponding label assigned by scientists at NASA regarding the probability of a Volcano being present in the data, although the certainty is not 100% anyways. The dataset was analyzed back then using machine learning approaches, but the advances that we are seeing today in that area could make it possible to run the same analysis without the use of any kind of specialized equipment, just using a simple laptop and an interpreted programming language.
